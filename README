About
FB-Words is a web based application that renders as an iframe inside Facebook 
(FB) UI. The applications makes use of the data (here words) stored inside the
'My Notes' section of the FB user profile page. 

Phase1
In this phase of the project, I will be adding the basic UI support to retrieve 
the user notes alongwith the code to retrieve word meaning from at least one
type of source.
